# Advent of Code 2022 one-liner

I implemented some of the tasks as one-liners in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

```console
$ ghci Day<day>.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Day<day>.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.

λ> part1
<answer for part 1>
λ> part2
<answer for part 2>
λ> main
<answer for part 1>
<answer for part 2>
```

Alternatively, build the executable with `ghc` and run it:

```console
$ ghc Day<day>.hs
[1 of 2] Compiling Main             ( Day<day>.hs, Day<day>.o )
Linking Day<day> ...

$ ./Day<day>
<answer for part 1>
<answer for part 2>
```
